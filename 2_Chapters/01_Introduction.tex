Finally, the documentation of testing and diagrams of laboratory setups can be found in the appendix.

\section{Project description} \label{sec:1.2_project_description}
In the following report, an analysis of a class-D amplifier module is documented. The work is conducted in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the \organisation. \\\\
An audio amplifier is a device that amplifies low-power audio signals within the audio spectrum perceptible to the human hearing to a level suitable for loudspeakers. It is typically the second last stage in an audio playback chain. While the input signal to an audio amplifier measures a low power, the output of the amplifier typically measures a high power delivery to the load, in this case, a loudspeaker. The output power of the amplifier depends on several key factors, characteristics of the output stage, heat dissipation, and parasitic elements among others. \\\\
A class-D audio amplifier is a typology of audio amplifiers that utilizes transistors as switches instead of gain devices as in other amplifier systems. As the transistors are operating non-linearly, the input signal is converted into a stream of pulses that resemble the input signal through a pulse-width modulation scheme. The time-averaged power of the modulated pulses is directly proportional to the input signal, so after amplification, the signal can be converted back into an analog signal through a passive low-pass filter. The purpose of this filter is to reduce high-frequency components in the amplified signal and thereby restore the audible spectrum frequency signal. \\

See \autoref{fig:01_classd_diagram} for a block diagram overview of a class-D amplifier system with waveform illustrations.
The primary benefit of the class-D topology is an increased power efficiency as the maximum theoretical power efficiency for class-D amplifiers are near 100\%, whereas Class-A- and Class-B amplifiers maximum theoretical power efficiency is 25\% and 78.5\%, respectively.\\

The design process in this project will be based on previous work by \cite{multivar_ctrl_loops_for_SM_audio_systems,nagy_special_course}. These two works explored using LQR in a control loop and minimizing the generated noise within the circuit from that implementation. The result was a circuit design that was implemented in-house within the DTU laboratory that is documented through an iterative design process.

\section{Project scope}
As this project deals with a synthesis of a peculiar design and an analytical examination of a class-D system, this initial design will determine the specific direction of the qualitative analysis. The project is focused on the output stage of the system. Therefore analysis will comprise of distinctive variations of parasitic element combinations in the chosen output filter topology.
