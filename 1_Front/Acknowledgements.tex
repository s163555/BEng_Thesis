The project would not be possible without the help and resources from every project participant. I would like to thank Arnold Knott for helping me start the project, arranging the collaboration with PURIFI Audio and taking the time to help me when needed. I would also like to thank SÃ¸ren Poulsen for helping me throughout the project.
