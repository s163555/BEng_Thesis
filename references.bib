The strategy is based on a thorough analysis of the loss mechanism and operating conditions of the power stage and how they relate to the audio input. The strategy utilizes a high ripple current combined with full state control improve soft switching capabilities. This result in a shift of losses from switching devices to ﬁlter inductors which are less sensitive to loss variations due to a larger form factor. Measured results on 100 W test ampliﬁers show that the proposed strategy reduces the power dissipation within the switches causing up to 45◦C temperature reduction locally in the switches and up to 35◦C globally in the ampliﬁer. THD+N levels are down to 0.03\% and power density of implemented ampliﬁers are 6 W/cm3.},

Normally the efficiency of a switch-mode audio amplifier is measured using a sine wave input. However this paper shows that sine waves represent real audio very poorly. An alternative signal is proposed for test purposes. The efficiency of a switch-mode power audio amplifier is modelled and measured with both sine wave and the proposed test signal as inputs. The results show that the choice of switching devices with low on resistances are unfairly favored when measuring the efficiency with sine waves. A 10\% efficiency improvement was found for low power outputs. It is therefore of great importance to use proper test signals when measuring the efficiency.",

	title={Self oscillating PWM modulators, a topological comparison},
	abstract={High precision control of the output voltage or current of a switch mode converter with fast response is required for a number of applications. Dependent on the type of application, the desired precision and transient response can be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with standard pulse width modulation (PWM) control caused by limitations in dynamic capabilities which often limits fast tracking of a reference signal, or fast settling during load steps due to too small achievable control loop bandwidth. Achievable open loop bandwidth for standard voltage and current mode PWM modulators is typical in the f/sub s//10 or f/sub s///spl pi/ range respectively, where f/sub s/ is the switching frequency of the converter. For some applications this will require unacceptable high switching frequency to achieve enough control loop bandwidth for the desired dynamic performance. With self oscillating modulators, the open loop bandwidth is equal to f/sub s/ which makes this type of modulators an excellent choice for a wide range of applications. Self oscillating PWM modulators can be made in a number of ways, either as voltage or current mode modulators, and the self oscillating behavior can be achieved either by using hysteresis control or by shaping the open loop function of the modulator so its gain and phase response causes a closed loop natural oscillation. The two main types of self oscillating modulators have many similarities, but differences in dynamic performance and linearity are present. The work presented is related to the author's work with switch mode audio power amplifiers, where linear tracking of the reference signal is of major importance. Use of the modulator topologies presented are not limited to this kind of equipment, but can be used in a very wide range of applications from very low to very high power levels.},
